<h2 class="para1">WATER POLLUTION</h2></center>
<p class="para">Water is uniquely vulnerable to pollution. Known as a “universal solvent,” water is able
to dissolve more substances than any other liquid on earth. It’s the reason we have Kool-Aid and brilliant 
blue waterfalls. It’s also why water is so easily polluted. Toxic substances from farms, towns, and
factories readily dissolve into and mix with it, causing water pollution.</p>
<h2 style="color: red">CATEGORIES OF WATER POLLUTION</h2>
<h3 class="para1"> GROUND WATER </h3>
<p class="para">For some folks in rural areas, it’s their only freshwater source. Groundwater gets
polluted when contaminants—from pesticides and fertilizers to waste leached from landfills and septic
systems—make their way into an aquifer, rendering it unsafe for human use. Ridding groundwater of
contaminants can be difficult to impossible, as well as costly. Once polluted, an aquifer may be unusable
for decades, or even thousands of years. Groundwater can also spread contamination far from the original
polluting source as it seeps into streams, lakes, and oceans.</p>
<h3 class="para1">SURFACE WATER</h3>
<p class="para">According to the most recent surveys on national water quality from the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, nearly half of our rivers and streams and more than one-third of our
lakes are polluted and unfit for swimming, fishing, and drinking. Nutrient pollution, which includes
nitrates and phosphates, is the leading type of contamination in these freshwater sources. While plants and
animals need these nutrients to grow, they have become a major pollutant due to farm waste and fertilizer
runoff.</p>
<h3 class="para1">OCEAN WATER</h3>
<p class="para">Eighty percent of ocean pollution (also called marine pollution) originates on land—
whether along the coast or far inland. Contaminants such as chemicals, nutrients, and heavy metals are
carried from farms, factories, and cities by streams and rivers into our bays and estuaries; from there they
travel out to sea. Meanwhile, marine debris—particularly plastic—is blown in by the wind or washed in
via storm drains and sewers. Our seas are also sometimes spoiled by oil spills and leaks—big and small—
and are consistently soaking up carbon pollution from the air. The ocean absorbs as much as a quarter of
man-made carbon emissions.</p>
