<h2 class="para1">SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</h2>
<p class="para">Sustainable development is the organizing principle for meeting human development
goals while simultaneously sustaining the ability of natural systems to provide the natural resources and
ecosystem services upon which the economy and society depend. The desired result is a state of society
where living conditions and resources are used to continue to meet human needs without undermining the
integrity and stability of the natural system. Sustainable development can be defined as development that
meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations.</p>
<h2 class="para1">GOAL 6</h2>
<p class="para">SDG6 is closely linked with other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For
example, improving sanitation also helps make cities more sustainable (Goal 11). Sanitation
improvements can lead to more jobs (Goal 8) which would also lead to economic growth (Goal 8).[2]
SDG6 progress improves health (Goal 3) and social justice (Goal 16).</p>
<h2 class="para1">TARGETS</h2>
<p class="para">SDG 6 has eight targets. Six of them are to be achieved by the year 2030, one by the
year 2020 and one has no target year. Each of the targets also has one or two indicators which will be
used to measure progress. In total there are 11 indicators for SDG6.<b>The first three targets relate to
drinking water supply and sanitation: </b>By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and
affordable drinking water for all By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and
hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and 
those in vulnerable situations. By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating
dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of
untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally.</p>
